## 🐳 Deployment

### Production Setup

```bash
# Use a production WSGI server
pip install gunicorn

# Run with gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

### Docker/Replit Limitations

Network scanning features require root privileges and are unavailable in containerized environments. The web interface, user management, and all CRUD operations work fully.

## 📊 Database Schema

- **devices** - Network device inventory
- **alerts** - Security alerts and notifications
- **rules** - Custom alert rule definitions
- **users** - User accounts and authentication
- **events** - System and network event log
- **system_config** - Persistent configuration
